Online Crime Reporting Application
Objective:
You will be building Online Crime Reporting Application using React
(Frontend), Spring Boot Microservices (Backend), and MySQL (database)
Project Overview:
An online crime reporting web application is a digital platform that allows users 
to report criminal activities or incidents to law enforcement agencies through 
the internet. It provides a convenient and efficient way for individuals to share 
information about crimes, suspicious activities, or other related concerns.
Key components and features typically found in Online Crime Reporting 
Application include:
User Registration: The application allows users to create an account by 
providing their basic information such as name, contact details, and address. 
This step ensures that the reported incidents can be associated with the correct 
individuals.
Incident Reporting: Once registered, users can submit reports regarding 
criminal incidents or suspicious activities they have witnessed or experienced. 
The application usually provides a form or questionnaire where users can 
provide detailed information about the incident, including the date, time, 
location, description of the event, and any other relevant details.
File Uploads: Users may have the option to upload any supporting evidence or 
files related to the incident, such as photos, videos, or documents. This 
additional information can help law enforcement agencies in their 
investigations.
Anonymity Options: Some online crime reporting applications offer the option 
to report incidents anonymously. This allows users to share information without 
revealing their identity, which can be particularly useful in situations where the 
person reporting the crime may fear retaliation or have concerns about privacy.
Location Mapping: The application may utilize mapping technology to allow 
users to pinpoint the exact location of the incident on a map. This feature can 
assist law enforcement agencies in identifying crime hotspots or patterns.
Case Management: Once an incident is reported, the application typically 
generates a unique case number or reference for tracking purposes. Law 
enforcement agencies can access the reported incidents through a secure 
interface and manage them accordingly, assigning officers or investigators to 
specific cases.
Status Updates: Users may receive notifications or updates regarding the 
progress of their reported cases, such as when the case is assigned to an officer, 
when additional information is required, or when the case is closed. This feature 
helps maintain transparency and keeps users informed about the actions taken 
by law enforcement.
Communication Channels: The online crime reporting application may 
include communication features to facilitate interaction between users and law 
enforcement personnel. This can include messaging systems, chatbots, or direct 
contact information for reporting agencies.
Data Security: Since online crime reporting involves sensitive information, 
robust security measures are implemented to protect user data and maintain 
confidentiality. Encryption, secure servers, and access controls are some of the 
methods employed to safeguard the system
